	<p> India, officially the Republic of India (ISO: Bhārat Gaṇarājya),[21] is a country in South Asia. It is
        the seventh-largest country by area; the most populous country as of June 2023;[22][23] and from
        the time of its independence in 1947, the world&#39;s most populous democracy.

		<h2> History</h2><br>
		<p>y 55,000 years ago, the first modern humans, or Homo sapiens, had arrived on the Indian
		subcontinent from Africa, where they had earlier evolved.[27][28][29] The earliest known modern
        human remains in South Asia date to about 30,000 years ago.[27] After 6500 BCE, evidence for
        agricultural surplus appeared in Mehrgarh and other sites in Balochistan, Pakistan

        <h2>Medivial India</h2><br>
        <p>The Indian early medieval age, from 600 to 1200 CE, is defined by regional kingdoms and cultural
		diversity. When Harsha of Kannauj, who ruled much of the Indo-Gangetic Plain from 606 to 647 CE,
		attempted to expand southwards, he was defeated by the Chalukya ruler of the Deccan.[111] When
		his successor attempted to expand eastwards, he was defeated by the Pala king of Bengal

	   	<h2> Geography </h2><br>
	   	<p>dia accounts for the bulk of the Indian subcontinent, lying atop the Indian tectonic plate, a part
		of the Indo-Australian Plate.[172] India&#39;s defining geological processes began 75 million years ago
		when the Indian Plate, then part of the southern supercontinent Gondwana, began a north-eastward
		drift caused by seafloor spreading to its south-west, and later, south and south-east.[172]
		Simultaneously, the vast Tethyan oceanic crust, to its northeast, began to subduct under the
		Eurasian Plate
